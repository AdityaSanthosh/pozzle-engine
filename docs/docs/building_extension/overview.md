# Overview

## Creating a extension from a template

Run the interactive generator:

```text
cd engine-integrations/extension-templates/generator
yarn
yarn generate
```

and choose the relevant template by using the arrow keys. This will generate a new extension in the `engine-integrations/extensions/<your-extension>` directory.
