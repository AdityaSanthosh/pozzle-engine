    <em>Poozle. The open-source Unified API for product integrations
</em>
</p>

Poozle provides a single API for each vertical, allowing you to connect all SAAS tools of that vertical at once. We do the hard work of integrating and smoothing over thousands of SAAS tools, exposing a clean and unified interface to developers. We aim to make it easy for companies to build new integrations. Our bet is that companies will choose to use our integration platform instead of building their own integrations or using multiple API integration platforms.
