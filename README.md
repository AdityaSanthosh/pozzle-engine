    <em>Poozle is an open-source, fast and reliable platform to integrate data from external APIs via a single integration layer.
</em>
</p>

We believe that only an **open-source** solution to API integration can cover the **long tail of API sources** while empowering developers to **customize existing extensions**. Our ultimate vision is to help you integrate with any API.

You can implement Poozle extensions in typescript language and take the form of a Docker image that follows the Poozle specification. You can create new extensions very fast with:

- The [Typescript EDK](https://docs.poozle.dev/)

## Contributing

Get started by checking Github issues and creating a Pull Request. An easy way to start contributing is to update an existing extension or create a new extension using Typescript EDK. You can find the code for the existing extension in the [extensions](https://github.com/poozlehq/poozle/tree/main/poozle-integrations/extensions) directory. The Poozle platform is written in NodeJS, and the front end is in React. You can also contribute to our docs and tutorials.
